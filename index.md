## CPSC 120 

* Lab 4
    Lab 4, part 1, called for us to create a program that converts units of mesurement. This lab was one of my favorite labs to do because it had practical real-life applications and helped me understand how programming can be used to solve everyday problems. This lab also helped my develop my debugging skills, as I had to test code and make sure that it was functioning correctly. 

* Lab 5
    Lab 5, part 2, which inclolved creating a function to calculate the score of a hand in Blackjack, was another one of my favorites becuase it was one of the very first programs I created that involved some type of game. Through this lab, I learned how to use structures such as conditonals and loops to calculate a hand's value. I also enjoyed this lab because it taught me how to think logically and critically about the game of Blackjack through analyzing the rules of the game and considerign different scenarios.

* Lab 12 
    Making our first animation in Lab 12, part 1 was my facorite because it was a fun and creative way to apply the programming concepts we learend in class. Through the lab, I learned how to use the Pygame lbrary to create animations and how to control object mocement using keyboard inputs. This lab was also a problem-solving excersize as my partner and I had to figure out how to adjust the animation's parameters to create the desired outcome.
